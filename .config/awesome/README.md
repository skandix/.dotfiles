# Awesome Configs
this is mostly Awesome-copycats work inn here i've only done some small tweaks with the diffrent things so it fits my diffrent debian boxes, if i ever need to do a reinstall  i can easily just git clone and deploy the diffrent themes + rc.lua config to the specified box 

i've started using the pro-black theme, with some tweaking to suit my workflow
